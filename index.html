      <p>I've always loved technology, computers, and the internet. In high school I took 2 years of computer classes that taught us both hardware and software. 
        I fell in love with web design but never pursued a career within the field. It's time I 
        pursue my interests in the field further and see if I'd enjoy web development as a career.
